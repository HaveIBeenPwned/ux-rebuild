# It's finally time
[It's only been 11 years!]([url](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/408153032698785792)) Same logo. Same layout. Same UX. And for the most part that was fine, but as HIBP has grown, we increasingly outgrew that decade-and-a-bit-old UX. 875 data breaches later, and HIBP has a fresh new look we're making available here as part of a "soft launch", that is we're giving everyone a preview before properly rolling it out.

This repository is intended to seek input from the community on a range of different aspects of the UX update. You'll see lots of discussions dating back more than a year when we first started seeking input, but now you'll also see the new brand, new HTML template and new UX paradigms. We're welcoming people to contribute to all of these in whichever way they see fit.

For more, check out [the soft launch blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/soft-launching-and-open-sourcing-the-have-i-been-pwned-rebrand) and if you just want to jump straight into the code, go to [the /web folder and check out the readme](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/ux-rebuild/tree/main/web). Thank you for reading, and especially for contributing!
