# A Decade is a Long Time...
[Well that escalated quickly]([url](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/408153032698785792)). 745 data breaches later and... not much has changed. Same logo. Same layout. Same UX. And for the most part that was fine, but as HIBP has grown, we're increasingly outgrowing that decade-old UX.

This repository is intended to seek input from the community on a range of different aspects of the UX update. I'm not sure exactly where this will go, we might crowd-source contributions to the likes of markup and CSS, we might just commercially engage someone / some company or I might just re-engage the left side of my brain and do it all myself. I expect input will be very much "divergent" to begin with and may go in lots of different directions until it converges somewhere logical.

I'm going to give GitHub Discussions a go just to begin seeking input and then I suspect we'll start collating various assets. I've created a discussion for each discrete component of the UX rebuild and welcome questions, comments and cool ideas from everyone.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and especially thanks for your contributions ðŸ˜Š
