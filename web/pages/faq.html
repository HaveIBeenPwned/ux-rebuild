                            The word "pwned" has origins in video game culture
                            and is a leetspeak derivation of the word "owned",
                            due to the proximity of the "o" and "p" keys. It's
                            typically used to imply that someone has been
                            controlled or compromised, for example "I was pwned
                            in the Adobe data breach".

                            A "breach" is an incident where data is
                            inadvertently exposed in a vulnerable system,
                            usually due to insufficient access controls or
                            security weaknesses in the software. HIBP aggregates
                            breaches and enables people to assess where their
                            personal data has been exposed.

                            HIBP enables you to discover if your account was
                            exposed in <em>most</em> of the data breaches by
                            directly searching the system. However, certain
                            breaches are particularly sensitive in that
                            someone's presence in the breach may adversely
                            impact them if others are able to find that they
                            were a member of the site. These breaches are
                            classed as "sensitive" and may not be publicly
                            searched.

                            A sensitive data breach can only be searched by the
                            <em>verified owner</em> of the email address being
                            searched for. This is done via the notification
                            system which involves sending a verification email
                            to the address with a unique link. When that link is
                            followed, the owner of the address will see
                            <em>all</em> data breaches and pastes they appear
                            in, including the sensitive ones.

                            Some breaches may be flagged as "fabricated". In
                            these cases, it is highly unlikely that the breach
                            contains legitimate data sourced from the alleged
                            site but it may still be sold or traded under the
                            auspices of legitimacy. Often these incidents are
                            comprised of data aggregated from other locations
                            (or may be entirely fabricated), yet still contain
                            actual email addresses unbeknownst to the account
                            holder. Fabricated breaches are still included in
                            the system because regardless of their legitimacy,
                            they still contain personal information about
                            individuals who want to understand their exposure on
                            the web. Further background on unverified breaches

                            provided HIBP with data from the Emotet malware in
                            April 2021. The risk posed to individuals in these
                            incidents is different (their personal device may be
                            compromised) hence the presence of this flag in

                            First of all, searches are not logged so there's no
                            collection of addresses. Any searches that
                            <em>are</em> performed are done so over an encrypted
                            connection so nobody has access to the web traffic
                            other than those hosting the HIBP services. Even if
                            they did, <em>it's only an email address</em> and
                            not enough to gain access to someone's online
                            accounts. If Pwned Passwords has also been used to
                            search for a password, it's anonymised before being
                            sent to HIBP so even a search for both email address
                            and password doesn't provide a usable credential
                            pair. Correlation does not imply causation; it's a
                            coincidence.

                            Occasionally, a breach will be added to the system
                            which doesn't include credentials for an online
                            service. This may occur when data
                            <em>about</em> individuals is leaked and it may not
                            include a username and password. However this data
                            still has a privacy impact; it is data that those
                            impacted would not reasonably expect to be publicly
                            released and as such they have a vested interest in
                            having the ability to be notified of this.

                            There are often "breaches" announced by attackers
                            which in turn are exposed as hoaxes. There is a
                            balance between making data searchable early and
                            performing sufficient due diligence to establish the
                            legitimacy of the breach. The following activities
                            are usually performed in order to validate breach
                            legitimacy:

                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              Has the impacted service publicly acknowledged the
                              breach?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Does the data in the breach turn up in a Google
                              search (i.e. it's just copied from another
                              source)?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Is the structure of the data consistent with what
                              you'd expect to see in a breach?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Have the attackers provided sufficient evidence to
                              demonstrate the attack vector?

                              Do the attackers have a track record of either
                              reliably releasing breaches or falsifying them?
                            </li>

                            A "paste" is information that has been "pasted" to a
                            publicly facing website designed to share content
                            such as Pastebin. These services are favoured by
                            hackers due to the ease of anonymously sharing
                            information and they're frequently the first place a
                            breach appears.

                            HIBP searches through pastes that are broadcast by
                            the accounts in the Paste Sources Twitter list and
                            reported as having emails that are a potential
                            indicator of a breach. Finding an email address in a
                            paste <em>does not</em> immediately mean it has been
                            disclosed as the result of a breach. Review the
                            paste and determine if your account has been
                            compromised then take appropriate action such as
                            changing passwords.

                            Pastes are often transient; they appear briefly and
                            are then removed. HIBP usually indexes a new paste
                            within 40 seconds of it appearing and stores the
                            email addresses that appeared in the paste along
                            with some metadata such as the date, title and
                            author (if they exist). The paste itself is not
                            stored and cannot be displayed if it no longer
                            exists at the source.

                            Whilst HIBP is kept up to date with as much data as
                            possible, it contains but a small subset of all the
                            records that have been breached over the years. Many
                            breaches never result in the public release of data
                            and indeed many breaches even go entirely
                            undetected. "Absence of evidence is not evidence of
                            absence" or in other words, just because your email
                            address wasn't found here doesn't mean that is
                            hasn't been compromised in another breach. An
                            address that was previously found in HIBP will no
                            longer appear if it has been opted-out or the data
                            was retired.

                            Some people choose to create accounts using a
                            pattern known as "plus aliasing" in their email
                            addresses. This allows them to express their email
                            address with an additional piece of data in the
                            alias, usually reflecting the site they've signed up
                            to such as test+netflix@example.com or
                            test+amazon@example.com. There is presently a
                            UserVoice suggestion requesting support of this
                            pattern in HIBP. However, as explained in that
                            suggestion, usage of plus aliasing is
                            <em>extremely</em> rare, appearing in approximately
                            only 0.03% of addresses loaded into HIBP. Vote for
                            the suggestion and follow its progress if this

                            HIBP provides a record of which breaches an email
                            address has appeared in regardless of whether the
                            password has consequently been changed or not. The
                            fact the email address was in the breach is an
                            immutable historic fact; it cannot later be changed.
                            If you don't want <em>any</em> breach to publicly
                            appear against the address, use the opt-out feature.

                            email (for example, the verification email sent when
                            signing up for notifications) and it doesn't arrive,
                            try white-listing that address. 99.x% of the time
                            email doesn't arrive in someone's inbox, it's due to
                            the destination mail server bouncing it.
