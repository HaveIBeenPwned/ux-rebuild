                      <p>
                        Thanks for your interest in the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) Services. Further down this page you'll
                        find the terms of use, written up by Australian lawyers (HIBP is owned and operated out of
                        Australia), I just wanted to give a brief "friendlier" introduction before the formal bits.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The intention of the terms of use is to ensure that HIBP is used, as I've always said, "to do
                        good things after bad things happen". Data breaches are an unfortunate reality of increasingly
                        online lives, but post-breach we can use that data to help reduce the impact on breach victims.
                        Using our Services to do that is awesome, whereas using our Services to disadvantage breach
                        victims, is not (that includes using it to pitch them services or "ambulance chase"). You're
                        welcome to go and build amazing things that use our Services, my ask is that if you do that and
                        display information from HIBP, that you clearly indicate the source.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Most of what you'll read in the terms is obvious and common sense: don't deliberately attempt to
                        disrupt the Services, don't redistribute your API key to other parties (this is your secret), if
                        you don't pay a recurring invoice for the Services, they'll be cancelled and so on and so forth.
                        By necessity, some of it is a bit "legal speak" which is why I wanted to set the context for why
                        upfront.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I hope you use our Services to create something wonderful that helps breach victims, thank you
                        for reading this and for your interest in HIBP.
                      </p>

                              <ol class="lowerAlpha">
                                <li>
                                  Controls such as rate limiting may be added to the domain search API if excessive API
                                  requests are made despite no new breaches appearing since the last request.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  In order to search a domain you must be able to demonstrate that you are the owner or
                                  controller of the relevant domain name.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Subscriptions for the Domain Name Search are based on the number of breached email
                                  addresses on the relevant domain (excluding email addresses that appear solely in
                                  breaches categorised as a "Spam List"). We do not guarantee the reliability or
                                  accuracy of the Domain Name Search and you acknowledge that the number of breached
                                  email addresses associated with a domain may be inaccurate (for example, due to
                                  fabricated email addresses and data parsing errors).

                                  where the Paid Services impose a rate limit, you must ensure that your use of the Paid
                                  Services does not exceed this limit. If you exceed the rate limit, we may impose
                                  controls on your Subscription to restrict your access to the Paid Services to prevent
                                  you from exceeding the set rate limit until such time as your usage of the Paid
                                  Services returns within the prescribed limit.
                                </li>

                                  Pricing for the Domain Name Search function is categorised into tiers and is based on
                                  the number of breached email addresses associated with the relevant domain (excluding
                                  email address that appear solely in breaches categorised as a "Spam List"). If, during
                                  your current Subscription Period, the number of breached email addresses associated
                                  with the domain increases and moves your account into a higher Subscription tier
                                  (known as a "domain creep"), you will still be able to query the domains within the
                                  scope of your purchased Subscription tier for the remainder of your then current
                                  Subscription Period regardless of the domain creep. If you do not upgrade your
                                  Subscription at the end of your then current Subscription Period to take into account
                                  the additional breached email addresses, we may restrict your access for future
                                  Subscription Periods.

                                  If during the Subscription Period your domain name exceeds the size that can be
                                  queried by our Paid Services (due to factors outside of our control such as
                                  infrastructure scale), you may provide us with written notice if you are no longer
                                  able to query the domain name as part of your Paid Services. Without limiting your
                                  other rights at law, if we are unable to rectify the issue within 10 days of receiving
                                  written notice, you may cancel your Subscription and request a refund for any unused
                                  pre-paid portion of the Subscription Fee.

                                  any amount that may be payable under the Terms is exclusive of any GST. If a party
                                  makes a Taxable Supply in connection with the Terms for a Consideration which
                                  represents its Value, then the Recipient of the Taxable Supply must also pay, at the
                                  same time and in the same manner as the Value is otherwise payable, the amount of any
                                  GST payable in respect of the Taxable Supply. A party's right to payment under this
                                  clause is subject to a valid Tax Invoice being delivered to the Recipient of the
                                  Taxable Supply.
