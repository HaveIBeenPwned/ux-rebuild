                        HaveIBeenPwned.com (HIBP) is owned and operated by
                        Superlative Enterprises Pty Ltd ABN 62 085 442 020
                        ("Superlative", "we" or "us"), a small business based in
                        the state of Queensland, Australia. We have created this
                        policy to explain what limited personal information we
                        collect when you use the HIBP site and how we handle and

                      <p>
                        HIBP's purpose is to help individuals and organisations
                        combat violations of privacy by enabling them to
                        identify when information has been involved in a data
                        leak. HIBP helps create visibility as to how personal
                        data spreads. Individuals and organisations may no
                        longer be able to control information once it is
                        breached, however, they can at least understand what has
                        been leaked, where it has been leaked from and what
                        precautionary measures should be taken as a result.

                        HIBP delivers a range of free and paid services to
                        individuals and organisations anywhere in the world to
                        help them determine if they have been impacted by a data
                        breach, including:

                        When we use the term personal information, we mean any
                        information or an opinion about an individual who is
                        identified or reasonably identifiable to us. Personal
                        information is sometimes also referred to as personal
                        data. We only collect the limited personal information
                        we need for the purposes of providing our services.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We collect and hold email addresses for the purposes of
                        providing our subscription services to verified email
                        addresses.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We collect and hold only the bare minimum logging
                        information required to keep the service operational and
                        combat malicious activity. This includes transient web
                        server logs, Google Analytics to assess usage patterns
                        and Application Insights for performance metrics. These
                        logs may include information submitted in a form by the
                        user, browser headers such as the user agent string and,
                        in some cases, the user's IP address.

                      <p>
                        We do not collect or store your personal information
                        when you conduct a search in the HIBP database.
                        Searching for an email address or phone number only ever
                        retrieves the data from storage then returns it in the
                        response. The data from the search is not explicitly
                        stored anywhere.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We also store some lists of data classes that were
                        impacted in a particular data leak that is loaded into
                        HIBP. For example, we will state that email addresses
                        and passwords appeared in a leak but will not provide
                        any information about which email addresses had
                        corresponding compromised passwords.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The information we collect is not always personal
                        information, as it may not relate to an identified
                        individual or we otherwise may not be able to identify
                        you from it.

                      <p>
                        The Pwned Passwords feature searches compromised
                        passwords from data leaks for the presence of a
                        user-provided password. The password is hashed
                        client-side with the SHA-1 algorithm then only the first
                        5 characters of the hash are sent to HIBP following the
                        Cloudflare k-anonymity implementation. HIBP never
                        receives the original password nor enough information to
                        discover the original password. No identifying
                        information about who the password belongs to is stored.

                        where they exist in an isolated data store not attached

                        data of any kind (like names) is stored on data load.

                        is loaded to establish if the subscriber appears in a
                        new breach, and to send an email notification to the
                        subscriber if required. These email notifications are
                        only ever sent to subscribers who 'double' opt-in to
                        receive notifications. This involves entering an email
                        address on the notification page or domain search page,
                        and then successfully proving control of the email
                        address through email verification. The verification
                        email contains a unique link which must be followed to
                        confirm the subscriber opts-in. Anti-automation measures
                        are in place to limit attempts to subscribe email
                        addresses in bulk.

                      <h5>Sensitive data breaches</h5>
                      <p>
                        Data breaches that we flag as sensitive are not returned
                        in public searches, they can only be viewed by using the
                        subscription service and verifying ownership of the
                        relevant email address first. Sensitive breaches are
                        also searchable by domain owners who prove they control
                        the domain using the domain search feature. For more
